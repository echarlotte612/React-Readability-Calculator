This **Readability Calculator** is a web app inspired by Harvard's CS50 problem set 1. It allows users to measure a text's readability and consequently grades it based on the [Coleman-Liau index](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi9p-DmjPryAhUTglwKHXGeDJ0QFnoECAMQAQ&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%25E2%2580%2593Liau_index&usg=AOvVaw17W52M17hvnnO9nEKDy4XB) 

The original code was written by myself in C and has been adapted into a React app using *create-react-app*.
